# React Pokedex

This is a simple application made with React to practice with context and reducers.
It allows to explore the 150 OG Pokemons by selecting them from a dropdown or navigate to the next one/ previous one with navigation buttons.

The state is managed with the useReducer hook and passed to the components with React Context.
The list of Pokemon is fetched from [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).
